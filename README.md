Library Database System

A simple library management database built with SQLite and a simple Python interface. This project provides the schema, lookup data, and foundational SQL scripts to support key library operations.

Requirements Used

Unique Book IDs: Each book has a unique ID number.

Search Functionality: Members can search for books by title, author, category, and publication year.

Multiple Authors: A book can have multiple authors.

Copy Tracking: There may be more than one copy of a book owned by the library.

Loan Records: Members can borrow books, and the system stores the date they borrowed the book.

Staff View: Library staff can see who has borrowed a particular book, past checkouts, member join dates, and member status.

Reservations: Members can reserve copies of books to borrow later if all copies are currently checked out.

Fines & Payments: Fines are imposed if books are not returned within 7 days of borrowing, and members can pay outstanding fines.
